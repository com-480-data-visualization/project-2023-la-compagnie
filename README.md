## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).


> We will use "Fluctuations of Glaciers (FoG) Database" (https://wgms.ch/data_databaseversions/) by World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS), and "Glacier Lake Outburst Flood Database V3.0" (http://glofs.geoecology.uni-potsdam.de/) by the university of Postdam. 

> quality of data ???

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

>

> This project will focus on Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). 
> Glacial lakes are lakes found at the foot of a glacier. They are formed by the melting of the glacier. Sometimes, when the lake is filled, or for geological reasons, the dam can fail or rupture, releasing large amounts of water downstream in what is known as a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). These events are difficult to predict and can cause devastating damage to infrastructure, settlements, and ecosystems, and also threaten human lives.  
> Glaciers are highly sensitive to climate change. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can have a significant impact on the size, shape, and behaviour of glaciers. As, on a global scale, temperatures rise, glaciers melt at a faster rate than they accumulate snow and ice. This leads to a decrease in glacier volume and mass, resulting in a visible retreat. 
> With our data visualisation, we want to show how glaciers evolve in an overall trend and link GLOFs episodes with observable changes.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

> The WGMs glacier data has already been used around the world to make analyses and predictions about glacier evolution, especially about climate change.  The GLOFs data of the University of Potsdam are mainly a compilation of numerous datasets from historical archives or other available data. These data make it possible to visualise spatially and temporally the different GLOFs episodes recorded. These data make it possible to visualise spatially and temporally the different leakage episodes recorded but also an analysis of the bias existing because of the increasing of the data recorded.
